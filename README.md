# silver-garbanzo
The project is intended to study Python's OpenCV lib with fun

# Requirements

I strongly recommend using a virtual environment like a `venv` lib.

Then you can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and voilá, your dependencies will be installed.

Have fun with this project. And as Uncle Ben said: `"... with great power comes great reponsability"`.
